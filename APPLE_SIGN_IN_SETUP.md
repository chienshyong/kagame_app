# Simplified Sign in with Apple Setup

I've implemented the Sign in with Apple button in your app with the following:

1. Added the `sign_in_with_apple` package
2. Created the `signInWithApple()` method in `AuthService`
3. Added the Sign in with Apple button to the login screen (only shows on iOS)
4. Created the necessary iOS entitlements files

## iOS Setup

To complete setup, you'll need to:

1. **Configure your Apple Developer Account**

   - Log in to [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list)
   - Go to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles
   - Select Identifiers and find your app's identifier
   - Enable "Sign in with Apple" capability by checking its checkbox
   - Save the changes

2. **In Firebase Console**

   - Go to Firebase Console > Authentication > Sign-in method
   - Enable "Apple" provider
   - No service ID is needed for native iOS Sign in with Apple

3. **Backend Implementation**

   Make sure your backend API supports `/applelogin` endpoint to handle the Apple authentication token.
